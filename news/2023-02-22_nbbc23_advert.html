	<h1>Nordic-Baltic Biometric Conference 2023 will be held in Gothenburg on June 16-18</h1>
	<p>
	  Warmly welcome to the Nordic-Baltic Biometric Conference 2023 which
	  will be held in Gothenburg June 16-18 (the weekend before
	  NORDSTAT). There will be key note speakers, invited sessions and
	  contributed sessions. The three key note speakers as well as the
	  organizers of the five invited sessions are all very knowledgeable
	  persons so we can definitely look forward to three interesting
	  days. We are also sure that many interesting contributions will
	  appear. Moreover, there will be plenty of time for meeting old friends
	  and creating new contacts during the welcome reception, conference
	  dinner, health sessions and lunches which except the conference dinner
	  will take place at the Scandic Crown hotel.
