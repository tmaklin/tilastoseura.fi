	<p>
	  It is crucial that national statistical offices can operate
	  independently from governmental or other political
	  pressures. Otherwise official statistics are likely to
	  become distorted undermining their informational content and
	  usefulness. Reliability of the official statistics is the
	  key element which enables societies to act meaningfully for
	  the good of their citizens, economy, and environment.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The charges against and convictions of Andreas Georgiou, the former
	  national statistician of Greece, are outraging. They are a cause for
	  great concern for statisticians and alike working for statistical
	  offices in Greece and elsewhere. By undermining the trustworthiness of
	  statistics, they are a threat to societies in general.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The Finnish Statistical Society endorses the call to end the
	  prosecutions against Andreas Georgiou and
	  the <a href="https://www.isi-web.org/images/news/PM_MitsotakisOctober2021.pdf">statement
	  of the heads of the American Statistical Association, the
	  International Statistical Institute, and the Royal
	  Statistical Society</a> of the 7th of October, 2021.
