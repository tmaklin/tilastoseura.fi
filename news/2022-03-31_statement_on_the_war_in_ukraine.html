	<h1>Statement on the war in Ukraine</h1>
	<p>
	  We at the Finnish Statistical Society are horrified by the Russian
	  invasion of Ukraine. We are appalled at Russia's unjustified use of
	  military force and blatant disregard for civilian casualties, and want
	  to express our deepest solidarity with the Ukrainian people and their
	  cause.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We urge the international community to extend all available
	  support to Ukraine and take any means necessary to end the war.
