	<h1>Finnish Young Statisticians Workshop 2021</h1>
	<h2>Tuesday November 30th @ University of Turku</h2>
	<p>
	  Welcome to The Finnish Young Statisticians Workshop (FYSW2021)!
	</p>
	<p>
	  FYSW is a networking event for doctoral students in statistics and
	  related fields. The workshop is organized by the Finnish Society of
	  Biostatistics in collaboration with the Finnish Statistical Society.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The meeting provides an excellent opportunity for academically young
	  statisticians to present their results and meet their peers. In this
	  event all of the speakers are doctoral students from different Finnish
	  universities. All registered doctoral students are guaranteed the
	  opportunity to present their work in the workshop. Furthermore, this
	  workshop is a fantastic environment to practice public speaking for
	  future conferences.  Note that you are not required to have any prior
	  publications or scientific results to attend this workshop. We
	  encourage fresh doctoral students to present ideas or general outlines
	  of your planned dissertation.
	</p>

	  A in the campus area of University of Turku, on Tuesday November
	  30th. The presentations are between 12:15 and 16:00, after which there
