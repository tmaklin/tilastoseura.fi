	  The next ECAS-SFdS school will take place from October 8 to 13, 2023,
	  on the French Riviera. The course entitled "Random forests: basics,
	  extensions and applications", will present, starting from the basics
	  on tree-based methods and popular tree ensemble methods, several
	  extensions of random forests and will demonstrate their ability in
	  applications coming from several domains. The link between random
	  forests and other popular machine learning techniques will also be
	  discussed, as well as some clues about the use of some more abstract
	  tools to analyse the behavior of random forests.
