            <p>
              With the support of the Otto A. Malmi Foundation, Foundation for Economic Education, the Wage Recipient Foundation and a government grant from the Finnish Ministry of Justice, we are developing the International Statistical Literacy Project (ISLP) which deals with the ability to read and use statistics. The contact persons for the project are Reija Helenius (reija.helenius(at)stat.fi) and Elisa Falck (elisa.falck(at)helsinki.fi). More information about the project can also be found on its website at <a href="https://iase-web.org/islp/">https://iase-web.org/islp/</a>.

              ISLP (i.e. International Statistical Literacy Project), the international project to promote statistical literacy, is part of the ISI (International Statistical Institute) and its sub-division IASE (International Association for Statistical Education). The ISLP has participants from all continents, and it has 176 country coordinators. Its operations are largely based on voluntary activities, in co-operation with associations, universities, research institutes, national statistical offices and educational institutions. The aim of the project is to promote the ability to understand and use statistics in all areas of life. Children and youth are the most important target group. Statistical literacy helps promote a democratic society, where the decisions of both citizens and decision-makers are based on information, not assumptions.

              The International Statistical Literacy Project (formerly the World Numeracy Project) was established in 1994 under ISI with the mission of promoting quantitative skills. Since 2010, the project has been managed from Finland. For its part, the project showcases Finnish know-how through the project and its stakeholder groups, such as the Finnish network of schools and teachers. During the period when the project’s leadership has been in Finland the worldwide network of country representatives has been formed, the website has been renewed, poster competitions have been launched, regular newsletters have been published and the importance of promoting statistical literacy has been actively highlighted in the form of conference presentations and articles, both in Finland and in the international community.
